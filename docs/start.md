### To participate in existing project

pushed it on your remote repository, and want your colleagues 
to participate. Say no more!

##### Clone your own repository

```

##### Export path (optionally)
This will allow you to use command **ins** without ./
```
./ins export
```

##### Install project

Keep in mind that you are installing **existing** project NOT creating new.

And that's it!
